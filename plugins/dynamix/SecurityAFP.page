> The Export setting determines whether this share is exported via AFP (Yes or No)
> The Export setting also includes a third option (Yes - TimeMachine).  This setting enables various
> special options for TimeMachine; in particular a "volume size limit".  Note: Apple recommends not
> to use the volume for anything but TimeMachine due to the way locks are used.

TimeMachine volume size limit:
: <input type="text" name="shareVolsizelimitAFP" maxlen="20" value="<?=$sec_afp[$name]['volsizelimit']?>"> MB

> This limits the reported volume size, preventing TimeMachine from using the entire real disk space
> for backup.  For example, setting this value to "1024" would limit the reported disk space to 1GB.

Volume dbpath:
: <input type="text" name="shareVoldbpathAFP" maxlen="20" value="<?=$sec_afp[$name]['voldbpath'];?>">

> Sets where to store netatalk database information.  A directory with same name as the share will be
> created here.
>
> Leave this field blank to have the database created in the root of the share.

> The unRAID AFP implementation supports Guest access and fully supports the three security
> modes: Public, Secure, and Private.
> In general, when you click on your server's icon in Finder, you will be asked to log in as Guest or to
> specify a set of login credentials (user name/password).  In order to use Secure or Private security on
> a share, you must have a user already defined on the server with appropriate access rights.
>
> Note: netatalk does not permit the user name <tt>root</tt> to be used for log in purposes.
>
> **Public** When logged into the server as Guest, an OS X user can view and read/write all shares set as
> Public.  Files created or modified in the share will be owned by user `nobody` of
> the `users` group.<br>
> OSX users logged in with a user name/password previously created on the server can also view
> and read/write all shares set as Public.  In this case, files created or modified on the server will
> be owned by the logged in user.
>
> **Secure** When logged into the server as Guest, an OS X user can view and read (but not write) all
> shares set as Secure.<br>
> OS X users logged in with a user name/password previously created on the server can also view and
> read all shares set as Secure.  If their access right is set to read/write for the share on the server,
> they may also write the share.
>
> **Private** When logged onto the server as Guest, no Private shares are visible or accessible to any
> OS X user.<br>
> OS X users logged in with a user name/password previously created on the server may read or
> read/write (or have no access) according their access right for the share on the server.
