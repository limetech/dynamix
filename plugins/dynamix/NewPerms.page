This is a one-time action to be taken after upgrading from a pre-5.0 unRAID server
release to version 5.0.  It is also useful for restoring default ownership/permissions on files and
directories when transitioning back from Active Directory to non-Active Directory integration.

This utility starts a background process that goes to each of your data disks and cache disk
and changes file and directory ownership to nobody/users (i.e., uid/gid to 99/100), and sets permissions
as follows:
~~~
For directories:
  drwxrwxrwx

For read/write files:
  -rw-rw-rw-

For readonly files:
  -r--r--r--
~~~
Clicking Start will open another window and start the background process. Closing the window before
completion will terminate the background process - so don't do that. This process can take a long time if you have many files.
