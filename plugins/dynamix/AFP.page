> ### Overview
> AFP for unRAID includes both `netatalk` to implement Apple Filing Protocol, and `avahi`
> to implement Zeroconf, aka, Bonjour.
>
> As with SMB and NFS, you may export both disk shares and user shares via AFP.  There are some important
> limitations to be aware of however:
>
> * You must be very careful when enabling AFP export of a disk share when that disk is also enabled
> for user shares. This is because `netatalk` creates several system directories in the root of shares,
> and these directories will show up as user shares. To prevent this, you may exclude the disk(s)
> from the user share file system on the [Share Settings](/Settings/ShareSettings) page.
>
> * The netatalk documentation includes a strong warning to not use symlinks anywhere in a file system
> being exprted via AFP.
>
> AFP for unRAID supports Time Machine, and all three security modes.
>
> ### Bonjour
> When AFP is enabled, your server name, with a `-AFP` suffix, should automatically appear in the left-hand pane of
> Finder alongside an Xserve icon.  Clicking this icon permits you to explore the server shares using AFP protocol.
>
> In addition, if SMB is enabled, your server name, without any suffix, should also appear.  This provides
> access to shares using the SMB protocol.
>
> ### Other notes
> [Prevent .DS_Store file creation on network volumes](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2005070300463515) - from the article:
>
> To prevent the creation of these files, open the Terminal and type:
>
>     defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
>
> It may be necessary to log out and back in, or even to restart the computer for the change to take effect
> (this is what the article states).
